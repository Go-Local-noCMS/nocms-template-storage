            Our story

          <div className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed space-y-5 text-left">
            <p>
              {skinConfig.brandName} started with a simple idea: most storage facilities are
              afterthoughts — converted warehouses, dim hallways, faceless leasing offices. We
              wanted something different. Purpose-built buildings with wide drive aisles, real
              climate control, and a manager who recognizes you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today we serve hundreds of customers across the metro. Personal storage during a
              renovation, business inventory for a growing online shop, vehicle parking through the
              winter — whatever you&apos;re storing, we&apos;ve probably stored something like it
              before.
            </p>
            <p>
              We&apos;re locally owned, month-to-month by default, and we never charge fees for
              things that should be free. That&apos;s the whole pitch.
